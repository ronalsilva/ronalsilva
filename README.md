# 👋 Hi there

I am Ronald Junger, a dedicated software developer and tech enthusiast with a strong passion for my craft.</br> Presently, I am actively seeking new and exciting opportunities. 
With a rich background spanning over 9 years in the industry, I have had the privilege to contribute to a diverse range of projects and delve into various cutting-edge technologies.


# 🚀 Expertise

I am a technology enthusiast and started my career on the frontend, developing modern frameworks with recommended design patterns. Over the course of almost seven years, I dedicated myself to honing my skills in frontend technologies, leading teams, establishing system guidelines and maintaining the highest standards of web performance and SEO. After my fifth year on the frontend, I decided to migrate to the backend, where I acquired and continue to improve my knowledge every day. I found passion in the backend, contributing to significant projects, leading teams and developing robust and efficient architectures.
In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Front-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier user interfaces, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.
